🏡 Chennai House Price Prediction

📌 Overview

This project predicts house prices in Chennai using Machine Learning. A Linear Regression model is trained on real estate data, considering factors like square footage, number of rooms, location, and build type to estimate property prices accurately.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and standardizes data.

✅ Feature Engineering: Computes property age, encodes categorical variables.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends and outliers.

✅ Model Training: Uses Linear Regression for prediction.

✅ Performance Evaluation: Assesses model accuracy with R² Score & Cross-Validation.
